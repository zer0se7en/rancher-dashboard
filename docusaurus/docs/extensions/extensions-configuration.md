# Extensions configuration

Follow instructions [here](./extensions-getting-started.md) to scaffold your extension. This will assist you in the creation of an extension as a top-level product inside Rancher Dashboard.

Once you've done so, there are some initialization steps specific to extensions. Beyond that, extensions largely work the same as the rest of the dashboard. There are a set of top-level folders that can be defined and used as they are in the dashboard: `chart`, `cloud-credential`, `content`, `detail`, `edit`, `list`, `machine-config`, `models`, `promptRemove`, `l10n`, `windowComponents`, `dialog`, and `formatters`. You can read about what each of these folders does [here](../code-base-works/directory-structure.md).
